# DALL-E Bot 

This bot experiments with the combination of:

- LLM Agent Tools
- A constrained, single-use interface

It is intended a proof-of-concept bot for exploration of ideas around
tool-driven architectures for user interaction, and how that might be scoped
down for user control.

### NOTE

## Creating a Telegram Bot

You can create a unique Telegram bot in 2 minutes using this package.

**Step 1**: Open Telegram, click the search icon, and open a chat with the `BotFather` bot.

**Step 3**: Give the bot a name (this does not have to be unique)

**Step 4**: Give the bot a username (this *must* be unique)

**Step 5**: Copy the full token (both the numbers and letters).  Keep this safe.

**Step 6 (Optional)**: Use the `/setuserpic` command to give your bot a profile photo.

**Step 7**: Visit https://steamship.com/packages/telegram-bot-with-tools/_create, fill out the three fields, and click create. 
If you wish to use GPT-4 instead of GPT-3.5, open Optional Configuration and change the value.  GPT-4 is slower and more expensive, 
but may produce more interesting results.

**Step 8**: Returning to Telegram, click the first link in the congratulations message, or search for your bot's username, and begin a conversation.
