# DISCLAIMER

This is intended as an initial Proof-of-Concept implementation of a Telegram Bot
powered by Tools that are selected and invoked by an LLM. There may be bugs in
how the Bot responds to inputs (and even with the implementation of the Tools).

Absolutely no guarantees are made as to the reliability of the source code itself,
or the behavior that emerges in conjunction with LLM-driven tool invocation.
